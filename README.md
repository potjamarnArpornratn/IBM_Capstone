# IBM_Capstone
Repo for IBM Data Science Capstone course works
This repo contains final Capstone project which consists of several labs that I did in order to clean the data and get insight.  
Then use the data for training ML models and evaluate the model as part of project tasks.    
You can view Jupyter Notebook files using https://nbviewer.org/ 
Final report "ds-capstone-Potjamarn_Arpornratn.pdf" will be created to present the findings.
